I think they way it has chnaged my life has been cool it has opened a new door to possiblities.With different activities of computer science and in general just being on a computer doing this will help me in the long run.

The way AI could help us is with our daliy lives and we do everyday like mapping technologies, voice-assisted smart phones, handwriting recognition for mail delivery, financial trading, smart logistics, spam filtering, language translation, and more.AI can be used to support digital communications, offering schedule reminders, tailored health tips and suggested next steps to patients.AI can analyze vast amounts of data to provide insights into learning patterns and trends, helping educators and policy-makers make informed decisions to improve teaching methods, curriculum design, and overall educational policies.And ways AI could harm us, AI could displace workers, erode job quality, increase unemployment, and exacerbate inequities.it can be biased and is often gullible when responding to leading questions. it can be coaxed into creating toxic content and is prone to 'prompt injection attacks' it can be corrupted by manipulating the data used to train the model (a technique known as 'data poisoning').So ultimately it could help us in ways and harm us.

It is important to protect our stuff online.However, if sensitive data falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to fraud, identity theft, or similar harms.We have to : use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), review privacy settings, avoid sharing sensitive information publicly, regularly monitor account activity, and utilize features like secret scanning on GitHub to detect potential leaks of sensitive data.Yeah posted some embarssing videos in tiktok like in 2020 that i regret doing but other than that i haven't shared anythimg else. use separate online identities for personal and professional use, leverage privacy settings on collaboration platforms, share only necessary information, utilize encryption for sensitive data, establish clear boundaries with collaborators, and be mindful of what you post publicly; effectively managing your digital footprint and ensuring you only share information you are comfortable with others seeing.

It makes voting much easier and acessible to people and on sociel media people can express their votes and debates on who's better and stuff like that.And potiental issue including malware and denial of service attacks; voter authentication; ballot protection and anonymization; and how disputed ballots are handled. The lack of a meaningful voter-verified paper record means there is not way to conduct a valid audit of the results. Voting apps and online voting also threaten the secrecy of ballots and the anonymity of voters, bedrock principles of our democracy. Online voting is simply not secure, nor will it be in the foreseeable future.

A recent significant development in AI is the advancement of "generative AI models" like Google's Bard or OpenAI's ChatGPT, which can produce highly realistic text, code, images, and other creative content based on user prompts, essentially mimicking human-like creativity and understanding. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of society, including education, content creation, and even software development by automating repetitive tasks and enabling rapid prototyping.Generative AI could personalize learning experiences by tailoring educational content to individual needs, generating practice questions, and providing instant feedback, making learning more interactive and accessible.Artists, writers, and designers could leverage AI to generate initial ideas, explore variations, and streamline the creative process, opening up new avenues for expression.Overall, generative AI represents a powerful tool with vast potential to transform various aspects of our lives, but careful consideration of its ethical implications and responsible development are essential to maximize its benefits and mitigate potential risks.

"Brain rot" refers to a perceived decline in cognitive abilities, often attributed to excessive consumption of trivial or unchallenging online content, leading to a feeling of mental fogginess, reduced attention span, and difficulty engaging with deeper material due to constant exposure to fast-paced, superficial digital media; for many, this year, digital media has had a negative impact on mental well-being, contributing to "brain rot" through overwhelming information overload and the tendency to compare oneself to curated online personas.For example The low taper fade meme is not just a meme it's a life style above our comprehension.

AI tools have the potential to both enhance opportunities for workers by automating repetitive tasks and increasing productivity, but can also limit opportunities by potentially replacing jobs in certain sectors, particularly those involving routine tasks, meaning the overall impact depends heavily on how AI is implemented and how workers adapt to the changing landscape; therefore, the effect on workers could be a mix of both enhancement and limitation depending on the specific job and industry.To prepare for a rapidly changing job market, focus on developing transferable skills, continuously learning new technologies and industry trends, building a strong professional network, and cultivating adaptability and a willingness to pivot when necessary.

Technological advances in secure data storage, data sharing, data analytics, and data visualization have the potential to enhance government transparency and accountability. Increased data accessibility allows citizens to understand how resources are being used and whether programs are effective.FBI Director Christopher Wray raises national security concerns about TikTok, warning that Chinese officials could manipulate the app's recommendation algorithm for influence operations.Overall could impact all of our sofware privavy.
