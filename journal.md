The lack of a meaningful voter-verified paper record means there is not way to conduct a valid audit of the results. Voting apps and online voting also threaten the secrecy of ballots and the anonymity of voters, bedrock principles of our democracy. Online voting is simply not secure, nor will it be in the foreseeable future.
